This project is a template for projects involving redirected walking using portals in VR in the unity game engine. It is based on the work my group had done for a [research project](https://github.com/Flame1190/CompSci-715-Unity), which in turn was derived from a [project by Daniel Lochner](https://github.com/daniellochner/portals-vr).
