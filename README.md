# VR Portals in Unity 2022

[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg?style=flat)](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)

This project is a template for projects involving redirected walking using portals in VR in the unity game engine. It is based on the work my group had done for a [research project](https://github.com/Flame1190/CompSci-715-Unity), which in turn was derived from a [project by Daniel Lochner](https://github.com/daniellochner/portals-vr). 

Most other open-source unity VR portal assets did not seem to work with more recent versions of unity. This became an issue as unity does not support OpenXR in older unity 2019 or earlier. This project works for unity 2022.3.5f1 and is designed to run on a Quest Pro/3 in standalone mode (or a Quest 2, but your performance may vary). However, it should be possible to modify it to run on PC. 

# Important Notes When Opening the Project for the First Time

When you attempt to open this project via github for the first time, a pop-up screen may appear saying that the project is dated before Unity versions 5.0. This is simply because our .gitignore excludes the unity version file. Simply open the project, and then revert any changes that are made by Unity (as Unity will add extra files assuming the project needed upgrading from a pre-Unity 5.0 version).

It is recommended to use project settings matching those in the "_Settings" folder. 

Finally, the baked lighting asset in the _Portals scene was too large to upload to github. While this isn't an isuse, it may mean that you will need to rebake any lighting data (however as this is a template project you probably want to use your own scene anyway).
